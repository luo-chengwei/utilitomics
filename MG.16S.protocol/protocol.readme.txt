This protocol extracts 16S reads from WGS metagenomes and assigns both ends to a certain OTU in greengene database.

## Steps of this protocol:
1. Run a probing blastn against a probe 16S sequence (e.g., the probe.fa file in this folder has E.coli K-12 16S sequence), and save the m8 format blast output as foo.bls, filter the results as you prefer (e-value, bit-score, etc);
2. run perl extractPaired.pl foo.bls   this will give you all the results that both ends mapped to 16S.
3. extract the sequences from your original read files (or trimmed reads) using the reads that were selected in step 2; save the extracted reads in file foo.PE.fa;
You can use the script extractSeq.pl to accomplish this step, you might need to modify the script a bit to fit your read's tag naming format though:
perl extractSeq.pl foo.PE.bls foo.read.fa foo.PE.fa
where foo.PE.bls is the output from step 2, foo.read.fa is the original read fasta file, and foo.PE.fa is the extracted reads in fasta format;
4. run blastn search using foo.PE.fa against GreenGene representative seq DB clustered at 99% nt identity (NOTE: use -m 8 -b 1 -v 1), save the m8 blastn output file (filtered using e-value, bit-scores as you prefer) as foo.PE.vs.GG99.bls;
5. assign taxonomy information to blastn output from step 4; run perl taxoAssign.pl foo.PE.vs.GG99.bls greengenes_tax.txt foo.PE.vs.GG99.tax; the annotated results are saved in foo.PE.vs.GG99.tax;
6. run perl taxoFilter.pl foo.PE.vs.GG99.tax foo.PE.vs.GG99.selected.tax to extract results that both ends hit the same OTU (the script filters at Order level now; to change to another level, for instance, genus level, edit the regex in the script, change all o's into g's);
7. The sequences in the output from step 6 are those you are looking for. Repeat the fastA read extraction in step 3, you will have the 16S read sequences in fasta format.

## Visualize the 16S mapping
in ./Viz/ we have several utility scripts that help you to visualize the 16S reads mapping to a reference gene, and it could guide your selection of regions of interest.

Note: you will need matplotlib to visualize the results.
command line:
python ./Viz/drawMapping.py probe.fa foo.bls foo.mapping.eps

You can replace probe.fa with anyothe reference 16S gene you like, here I use the E.coli K-12 16S gene an example; foo.bls is the -m8 blastn search output file, and foo.mapping.eps is the ouput figure you desire to generate in EPS format.

Happy hacking!
